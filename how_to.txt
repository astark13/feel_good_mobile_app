In order to create the ".apk" file you need a Linux environment. 

!!!The script installing the prerequisites is configured for Ubuntu,
 so you either stick to Ubuntu or modify the script!!!

1. Download the folder containing all the file of the onto your Ubuntu machine.
2. In the folder containing all the files run the following command:

    bash kivy-buildozer-installer.sh

3. Try if the app works

    python3 main.py

4. Create "buildozer.spec" file

    buildozer init

5. Alter the "buildozer.spec" file. The following lines need to be changed:

    title = My Application --> title = How Do You Feel?

    source.include_exts = py,png,jpg,kv,atlas --> source.include_exts = py,png,jpg,kv,atlas,json,txt

    orientation = portratit --> orientation = all

6. Run the command to create the ".apk" file

    buildozer android debug

    buildozer android clean debug - run this if errors occur, after the errors were fixed;
                                    it clean what was wrong when the error occured

7. In the application folder a "bin" folder appears. In there you find the ".apk" file

8. Upload the ".apk" on "wetransfer.com" and download it onto your phone.
